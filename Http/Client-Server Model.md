# The Client-Server Model

The `client-server model` describes the relationship between two programs: 
1. one program called the **client**, which requests a service or resource,
2. and one program another called the **server**, which provides it.
    
This interaction is the foundation of modern networking — every time you browse a website, check your email, or stream a movie, you are using this model.  
It enables communication and resource sharing between devices over a network, making it a key concept behind the Internet and HTTP.

| Concept | Description | Examples | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Client** | Sends requests to access information or services from a server. | Web browser, email app, mobile app | Acts as the requester |
| **Server** | Receives client requests, processes them, and sends responses back. | Web server, database server, mail server | Can serve many clients at once |
| **Interaction** | Client → sends request → Server → processes → sends response → Client receives result | A browser requesting an image from a website | Roles are relative; a device can be both client and server in different contexts |
| **Importance** | Enables communication, resource sharing, and distributed computing across networks. | Internet, cloud services, databases | Core principle behind HTTP and the web |
